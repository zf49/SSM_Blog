SSM practice

This is a Blog project which is the updated version of CS718, 719

In CS718 & 719 project, i just use java web tech stack to complete. 

for this project, i use Spring 5 + Spring MVC + MyBatis + Maven + Tomcat + jsp + JSTL to complete.

Although i haven't beautified the front page, i still finfish the basic function

---

1. log in , sign up and log out
2. Interceptor, if user didn't login or sign up the page will redirect to localhost:8080
3. edit or change personal detail
4. every user can comment the article
5. every user can write article

-----------

the place need to be perfected

1. user Avator(file upload and download)
2. front-end UI
3. nested comments
4. Some codes do not comply with the rules of maintainability
